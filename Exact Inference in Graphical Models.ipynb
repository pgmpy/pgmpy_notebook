      "Inference is same as asking conditional probability questions to the models. So in our student example we might would have liked to know what is the probability of a student getting a good grade given that he is intelligent which is basically equivalent of asking $ P(g^1 | i^1) $. Inference algorithms deals with efficiently finding these conditional probability queries.\n",

      "### Variable Elimination\n",
      "The basic concept of variable elimination is same as doing marginalization over Joint Distribution. But variable elimination avoids computing the Joint Distribution by doing marginalization over much smaller factors. So basically if we want to eliminate $ X $ from our distribution, then we compute the product of all the factors involving $ X $ and marginalize over them, thus allowing us to work on much smaller factors. Let's take the student example to make things more clear:\n",
